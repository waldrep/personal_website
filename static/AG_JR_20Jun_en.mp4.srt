00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,280
Hey, where did all the fish go?

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,640
 I don’t know

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,720
Hello, my name is Olafur. I am an artist

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,680
and I made a work of art called Earth Speakr

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,360
Let me show it to you

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,360
With the artwork, you can make a tree talk

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,080
You can make the sky cry, a rock on the

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,040
maybe it's like, screaming at you

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,520
and the flowers, they can be smiling

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,200
You can really say anything you want to say 

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
or tell us to do about 

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,920
how do we make the planet safe for the future

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,040
You could consider making me in more climate friendly materials

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
Just a thought!

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,080
And then I promise I will take that and try to deliver it

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,880
to the politicians, to the people in power so they listen to you

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,560
It’s simple to use

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,880
You will see how it mirrors your face and your expressions

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,920
Then think about what you want to say

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,360
You record your message

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,400
I don’t want plastic inside my fish!

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,520
And then you place it where you want to have it

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,720
Your message then can join a community

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,240
of other messages

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,200
Soon your message will be in the world

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,960
And if you have Earth Speakr on your phone,

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,480
you can see other kids’ messages, and they can see yours

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
 in augmented reality

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,720
See, each of these glass spheres is actually a message

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,880
 So you can zoom in when you find it and tap on it, and then you can hear the message

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,760
You can pick your favourite message and then share it with your friends

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,400
And you can make your own and send it off

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,040
You can tell your parents or a grown-up friend

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,480
 to look at the messages on earthspeakr.art

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,160
Adults cannot make their own messages; this is just for kids

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,440
But they can make really cool Loud Speakrs

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,680
on a map

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,840
and the more Loud Speakrs, the more grown-ups will also see your messages

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,120
Now everyone can see your Loud Speakr in augmented reality

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,000
through the Earth Speakr app

41
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,800
Earth Speakr is for you

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,240
it’s for your friends, it’s for everyone

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,920
and it’s about having fun, being creative, playing

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,880
But it’s also about saying, what do we need to do for the planet?
