				<p>Produced during my time at <a target="_blank" href="http://u-tt.com">Urban-Think Tank</a> at ETH ZÃ¼rich, the People's Museum was produced for Sarajevo Now, an official collateral exhibition of the 2016 Venice Biennale of Architecture. It takes as its subject the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo, a modernist monument of the bygone Yugoslav era and an enduring symbol of the continuing political strife in the country.</p>

				<p>The other main effort in which I was involved at U-TT was the documentation of the <a href = "http://u-tt.com/project/empower-shack" target="_blank">Empower Shack</a> project, a design research and architectural design project on housing conditions in Khayelitsha, the outermost township serving Cape Town, South Africa. This video, which I edited and produced motion graphics for, was one of several products that came out of the still-ongoing process.</p>

				<p>In recent months I've been collaborating with the Berlin-based agency <a target="_blank" href="http://plane-site.com">Plane-Site</a> on a number of video and research projects. Here are two of note: an interview I shot and edited with Alejandro Aravena at the opening of his 2016 Venice Biennale, and the official video for the U.S. Pavilion, which I edited.</p>
